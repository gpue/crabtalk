//! Hook trait — lifecycle backend for agent building and execution.
//!
//! Hook abstracts the lifecycle of building and calling agents. Runtime
//! delegates to Hook at specific points: `on_build_agent` before registering
//! an agent, `tools`/`dispatch` during each step, and `on_event` after each
//! step completes.

/// Implementations provide tool schemas, tool dispatch, prompt enrichment
/// (via `on_build_agent`), and event observation. Runtime holds `Arc<H>`
/// and calls these methods at the appropriate lifecycle points.
